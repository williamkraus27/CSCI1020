  Hello,\
  This repository contains my code for two programs that each find the length of the longest common subsequence between two DNA sequences.\
  Each program accepts two explicit strings, a number, or no user arguments. I have integrated argpase in both to add a command line interface\
  allowing users to check the program description, as well as the inputs both programs accept.
